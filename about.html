            <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
            <p>The night was like any other, I had just gotten off of my 84 hr shift at the Amazon Warehouse, unpaid of course.
                I was craving something, anything, but there was nothing opened at 4am. Then it hit me, what if I opened my own restaurant ? 
                I then started my planning, I reached out to my roommate's sister-in-law who is of Thai deccent (she informed me she was Vietnamese, but whatever close enough) and asked if she had any 
                secret traditional recipies passed down within their family. (My roommate and I are basically family so, by this logic she and I are also indirect family). 
                After months of extremely hard labor, nonstop days, and minutes of sleep a night.. Amazon finally let me have a day off, so I could start working on the restaurant.
               </p><p> That was a week ago, and now we're opening up our first stand-alone restaurant in Downtown.
